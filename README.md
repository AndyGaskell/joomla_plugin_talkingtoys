# Talking Toys, a weird little Joomla plugin
This is a Joomla Plugin to display images with speech bubbles

## History
I had a long late night wait in Schipol airport, on the way back from J and Beyond in Cologne.  I was too tired to do serious dev work, so just tinkered up this simple plugin.  I'd done some sketches of a new site design while listerning to Chiara's keynote, and this was sort of part of the design.  The idea is that the talking toys would help tell a story and add some levity to page content.

## Usage examples

{talkingtoy}Hey, like, hello world, or something{/talkingtoy}

{talkingtoy}Yo, sup dude{/talkingtoy}

{talkingtoy fred.png}Hiya :){/talkingtoy}

{talkingtoy}Dude, wheres my car? :){/talkingtoy}

{talkingtoy fred.png L}I'm quite a chatty toy, a few words here, but not war and peace.  Also, my image is set.{/talkingtoy}

{talkingtoy dude.png R}I'm a dude, floating right{/talkingtoy}

{talkingtoy L}I'm floating left{/talkingtoy}

{talkingtoy R}I'm floating right{/talkingtoy}

{talkingtoy N}I'm not floating{/talkingtoy}
